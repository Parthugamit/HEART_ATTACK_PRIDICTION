# HEART_ATTACK_PRIDICTION
Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates. This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to predict heart disease based on various medical parameters such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart rate.
Problem Statement
Traditional methods of diagnosing heart disease rely on manual assessments and tests, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Our goal is to develop an AI-based solution that can accurately predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient data.
Objectives
●
To analyze and preprocess medical datasets related to heart disease.
●
To apply various supervised learning models for classification.
●
